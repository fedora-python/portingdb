    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      In [a bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1328871),
      the maintainer clarified:

      > so to be clear, gnome-desktop is an old library not used by much
      > anymore. it doesn't have python bindings in the tarball. Those are
      > provided by gnome-python2-desktop.
      >
      > gnome-desktop3 is actively used (in very limited ways), but it relies
      > on gobject introspection to bind to python.

      Note that since
      [gnome-desktop3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-desktop3/)

      While upstream is making progress porting m2crypto, moving to the
      cryptography module, and the cryptography features in Python's standard
      library, seems to be a better long-term option for dependent projects.

      On the other hand with the package ported, downstream users won't
      have to port their crypto to new library.

        not necessary.

        Suggested replacement: `python-gobject` (provides the `gi` module)

      Dependency on both Python 2 and 3 is intentional: Main codebase of

      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support

python-peak-rules:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.
python-pydns:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Recommended replacement: `python3-py3dns`
python-pylons:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Recommended replacement: `python-pyramid`
python-pyudev:
  nonblocking: true
  note: |
    Some backends are not yet ported.
python-simpletal:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    The Python 3 version is packaged as `python3-simpletal`.
python-slip:
  status: released
  note: |
    The only not ported part is the subpackage `gtk` containing a single
    convenience function for a dropped package `pygtk2`.
python-statistics:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is a backport of `statistics`, part of the Python 3.4
    standard library.
python-subprocess32:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-tgcaptcha2:
    status: blocked
    note: |
        Depends on `python-fedora-turbogears` (part of `python-fedora`),
        which is not ported (as of 2016-05-02).
python-tgmochikit:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      javascript framework like jquery.
python-toscawidgets:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-turbocheetah:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream   Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      templating library like jinja2.
python-turbojson:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 where this
      isn't needed.
python-turbokid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and
      a different templating language (genshi is similar to kid) where this
      isn't needed.
python-TurboMail:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-marrow-mailer`

      Upstream is dead, project continues under the new name.
python-tw-forms:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-forms

python-unicodenazi:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      As the upstream page says, this package is "only useful when porting over
      libraries from Python 2 to Python 3."
python-upoints:
    note: |
      Depends on [aaargh](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aaargh/0.7.1),
      which isn't packaged yet.
python-urlgrabber:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      There was a concerted effort to port this package, but it was
      ultimately decided it is unportable (among other things due to dire
      lack of test coverage).
      Suggested replacement: `python-pycurl` which covers most of the
      functionality
python-weakrefmethod:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of [weakref.WeakMethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakMethod) from Python 3.4+.
      Use the stdlib version in Python 3.
python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webob`
python-webtest1.3:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webtest`
python-whisper:
    note: |
        Whisper as library is python3 compatible, but the executables not yet.
python-zbase32: &pyutil-zbase32-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Only `python-zbase32` depends on `pyutil`, and `pyutil` depends back
      on `python-zbase32`.
python2-faulthandler:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Part of the the standard library in Python 3.3+.
python2-ipython:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `ipython`
python2-lxc:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python3-lxc`
python2-typing:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        The `typing` module is part of the standard library in Python 3.5+;
        no need for this backport there.
python2-pyx:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `PyX`
pyutil: *pyutil-zbase32-cycle
pywebkitgtk:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This package provided customized static Python bindings to a GTK
        library.
        GTK3 and GObject introspection provide dynamic bindings that do not
        need to be customized for each language, thus this package is
        not necessary.

        Suggested replacement: `python-gobject` (provides the `gi` module)
        and `webkitgtk4` (provides the `gi.repository.WebKit2` module).
        Note that `webkitgtk4` is not specific to Python and thus does
        not show up in portingdb.

        [An example] that works with Python 3 is provided on the GTK wiki.

        [An example]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/WebKitGtk/ProgrammingGuide/Bindings-libnotify
subunit:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        A Python 3 subpackage exists, but isn't packaged well yet.
        Also the plugins aren't ported.
tomoe-gtk: *devel-only
tracer:
    note: |
      Upstream supports python3, fedora packager(=upstream) promised to update the spec file. (2016-03-11)
TurboGears:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      TurboGears-1 is not seeing further upstream development.
      Suggested Replacement: TurboGears2 (Similar API but porting will be needed)
vegastrike: &vegastrike-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Only `vegastrike` depends on `vegastrike-data`, and `vegastrike-data` depends back
      on `vegastrike`.
vegastrike-data: *vegastrike-cycle
vte:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Replacement: [`vte3`](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/)
    (Note that [vte3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/) does
    not itself depend on Python, so it does not show up in portingdb).
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
yum:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `dnf`
yum-metadata-parser:
    status: dropped
    note: |
