        Bug 1187837 - A file in the python2 backage requires python3.
python:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is the Python 2 package.
      Please port to Python 3.
python-backports:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        By definition, the new Python version does not need backports!

python-cherrypy2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that needs to be run on

python-docs:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python3-docs`
python-irclib:
    note: |
        Update with python3 support has been [packaged in copr](https://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/toshio/python-irclib-update/).
        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.
