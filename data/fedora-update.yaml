        repo: https://github.com/dperson/byobu
    note: |
        [dperson] Pull accepted upstream (will be in 5.100). Updated the `spec`
        file to fix the she-bang lines on build. Submited it to the maintainer.
        Maintainer will wait on Fedora 24 to change script interpreter.

      Suggested replacement: `pygobject3`
hippo-canvas: &sugar-toolkit
    status: dropped
    note: |
        From the maintainer, on
        [BZ#1737929](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1737929#c7):

        We're looking to deprecate `hippo-canvas` *\[and `sugar-toolkit`\]*,
        it was used in the old
        gtk2 *\[Sugar\]* Activities, there's a few more to migrate to the gtk3.

        There's overall been a multi year effort to move to python3 including
        moving from gstreamer 0.10 python bindings to py3 friendly
        introspection based gst 1.0 bindings etc.
        There's only a handful of gtk2 based Activities left
        (`repoquery --whatrequires sugar-toolkit`)
koji:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Lots of the codebase it ported. This includes the Python library.
        Dependencies that use the library or call koji binaries directly
        can begin porting.
libkdtree++:
    dead-upstream: true
m2crypto:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Possible replacement: `python-cryptography` (or Python standard library).
magicor:
    dead-upstream: true
mailman:
    note: |
        Mailman 3 with Python 3 support is ready but should be packaged separately.
        More info on the status of the new package can be found in a
        [Fedora bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1363871).
notify-python :
    note: |
        Suggested replacement: `python-notify2`
nut:
    note: |
        As discussed in a [Fedora bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1323261),
        nut is not ready for Python 3.
postgresql:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Only postgresql-upgrade and postgresql-contrib depend on both Pythons, but this is intentional
        as discussed in a [Fedora bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571215).
pydot:
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-pydotplus`
pygame:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        No `python3-pygame-devel` equivalent
pygobject2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gobject`
pygtk2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gobject`
python27:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is the Python 2.7 package.
      Please port to Python 3.
python-backports:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        By definition, the new Python version does not need backports!
python-BeautifulSoup:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-beautifulsoup4`
python-enum34:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      `enum` is part of the Python 3.4 standard library, so this backport
      is not needed.
python-futures:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is a backport of `concurrent.futures`, part of the Python 3.2
    standard library.
python-igor:
    note: |
        The package is functional under python3, but the executable output
        is  slightly nicer under python2. So it is on py2 on purpose
        according to the maintainer.
python-inotify:
    status: released
    note: |
        `python2-inotify-examples` only contains examples of how `python2-inotify` can be used and does not need to be ported.
python-kerberos:
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python2-more-itertools:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-more-itertools`
python2-numpy:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is the Python 2 version.
        The `numpy` package provides `python3-numpy`.
python-oslo-config:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        The main package is ported to Python 3
python2-pluggy:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is the compat package; `python3-pluggy` is pprovided by `python-pluggy`.
python-pydns:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Recommended replacement: `python3-py3dns`
python2-pytest:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is the Python 2 version.
    The `pytest` package provides `python3-pytest`.
python2-setuptools:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is the Python 2 version.
    The `python-setuptools` package provides `python3-setuptools`.
python-subprocess32:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-zbase32: &pyutil-zbase32-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Only `python-zbase32` depends on `pyutil`, and `pyutil` depends back
      on `python-zbase32`.
python2-typing:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        The `typing` module is part of the standard library in Python 3.5+;
        no need for this backport there.
pyutil: *pyutil-zbase32-cycle
sugar-toolkit: *sugar-toolkit
texlive-base:
    status: idle
    note: |
        texlive-pythontex depends on both Pythons by design upstream. See discussion
        in the Bugzilla for more details.
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
wxPython:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python-wxpython4`
