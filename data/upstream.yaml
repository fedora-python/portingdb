abiword:
  note: |
    The single Abi.py file provided upstream is a tiny stub that has no
    compatibility issues. However, the make file component supplied to
    install it contains a command line invocation of Python that's not
    compatible. This has now been corrected in trunk upstream, and should
    be released in Abiword 3.1.

  note: |
    Upstream does not presently support Python 3. They are currently dependent
    upon PyGTK (rather than PyGObject), which only supports Python 2. They are
    planning significant refactoring work, and it seems unlikely porting would
    occur prior to that.

solfege:
  status: idle
  note: |
    Not Python 3 compatible (though the change log makes reference to a
    Python 3-related fix), which is apparent through code inspection and
    the fact it depends upon PyGTK2.
