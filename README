A database of packages that need porting to Python 3, and tools to manage it.

This software is a mess. It was created for one purpose and was expected to not be needed soon.
Meanwhile, hacks are piling on.

# Deployed report

A HTML report is located at:

    https://fedora.portingdb.xyz/

Unless you want to refresh data there, or run additional reports, you can just look at that.

# Installation

This software is not released.
To install it, first set up a
[Python virtual environment](https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/python/python-installation.html).
Then run directly from Git working directory:

    (venv) $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage

To start a HTML report server, start:

    (venv) $ export PYTHONPATH=.
    (venv) $ python -m portingdb serve

# Check drops

There is a script that checks what python2 packages can be dropped from Fedora
during the [Mass Python 2 Package Removal](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Mass_Python_2_Package_Removal).

Change your Python virtual environment to include system side packages:

    (venv) $ cat venv/pyvenv.cfg
    ...
    include-system-site-packages = true
    ...

Reactivate if needed:

    (venv) $ deactivate
    $ . venv/bin/activate

And run it with:

    (venv) $ python -m portingdb --datadir data/ check-drops

See the docstring of [portingdb/check_drops.py](./portingdb/check_drops.py)
for more info.

# Freezing

   A static website with the HTML repot can be build by:

    (venv) $ export PYTHONPATH=.
    (venv) $ python elsasite.py freeze

   You can add `--serve` for he `freeze` command to immediately inspect the result.
