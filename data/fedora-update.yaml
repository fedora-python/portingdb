antlr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      Replacement: `python-gstreamer1`
libssh2-python:
    note: |
        Code is old, but it's just a binding: it seems to work with Python 3.4
        Should it be renamed python{2,3}-libssh2?

        This has been ported. All we're waiting for is for upstream to point the sources to this repo.
lunatic-python:
    note: |
        There is a better alternative which supports Python3, Lupa.
m2crypto:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-cryptography` (or Python standard library).

      While upstream is making progress porting m2crypto, moving to the
      cryptography module, and the cryptography features in Python's standard
      library, seems to be a better long-term option for dependent projects.

      Upstream may be dead.

    note: |
      This is the Python 2 package.
      Please port to Python 3.
python-atfork:
    status: dropped
    note:
        As mentioned in the upstream pull request, upstream considers this
        project dead.

        Since nothing depends on it in Fedora, porting it does not seem useful.
python-backports:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        By definition, the new Python version does not need backports!
python-backports-lzma:

python-cherrypy2:

    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that needs to be run on
      python3 needs to be ported to a current version of this framework.
      Replacement: `python3-cherrypy`
python-clientform:

        This is an old version of the dateutil library.
        Replacement: `python-dateutil`
python-django-profiles:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Due to changes in Django making it effectively obsolete, this
        application is no longer maintained.
        Replacement: `python-django`
python-docs:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python3-docs`
python-elixir:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.
python-enum34:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      `enum` is part of the Python 3.4 standard library, so this backport
      is not needed.
python-futures:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is a backport of `concurrent.futures`, part of the Python 3.2
    standard library.

python-HTMLgen:

python-ipaddr:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Python 3.3+ includes the `ipaddress` module, which has been backported
        to Python 2 (`python-ipaddress`).

        Packages that depend on `ipaddr` should consider porting to `ipaddress`.
python-ipaddress:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        In Python 3.3+, ipaddress is in the standard library.
        This is a backport for earlier versions.
python-instant:
    note: |
      spec file updated and built in rawhide by [fab](http://fabian-affolter.ch).
python-irclib:
    note: |
        Update with python3 support has been [packaged in copr](https://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/toshio/python-irclib-update/).
        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.
python-kerberos:
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python-kid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-genshi`
      Not a drop-in replacement but genshi's templating language is based on
      kid's so it's the closest thing.  python-kid is dead upstream.
python-krbV:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python-ldap:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-pyldap` (drop-in, provides the `ldap` module)
python-lzo:
    note: |
            A new upstream maintainer has appeared and [merged python3 support](https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo/pull/8) to their
            tree but still needs to [make a new release](https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo/issues/9).
python-matplotlib:

python-musicbrainz2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        From the [project homepage](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/python-musicbrainz2):

        > Deprecated as of May 2011. This library is not compatible with the
        > current MusicBrainz schema, but will still work with older versions
        > and with the ws/1 legacy web service.

        There is a newer bindings library: `python-musicbrainzngs`.
python-mutagen:

python-peak-rules:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.
python-prioritized_methods:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    See the notes for [python-peak-rules](http://fedora.portingdb.xyz/pkg/python-peak-rules/)
    which this depends upon.

  note: |
    Some backends are not yet ported.
python-subprocess32:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-tgmochikit:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      javascript framework like jquery.
python-toscawidgets:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-turbocheetah:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream   Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      templating library like jinja2.
python-turbojson:

    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 where this

python-turbokid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and

      This is a backport of [weakref.WeakMethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakMethod) from Python 3.4+.
      Use the stdlib version in Python 3.
python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webob`
python-webtest1.3:

      Suggested Replacement: TurboGears2 (Similar API but porting will be needed)
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
