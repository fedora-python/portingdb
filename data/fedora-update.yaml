python-irclib:
    note: |

        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.

python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |

      The fedora packager is also upstream.
will-crash:
    status: released
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
