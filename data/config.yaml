## You can set "extra-css" to any additional CSS, for example:
# extra-css: |
#     a { color: red; }

## The string in "message" will get displayed in a footer on every page.
## For example, a private portingdb may say "Internal Use Only".
## The footer has class "global-message", so you can style it with "extra-css".
# message: Hello World!

# General porting instructions go in "main-instructions", as HTML.
# They're displayed as (almost) the first thing on the main page.
# The string '$RANDOMPKG' will be replaced by a random "idle" package, if
# it occurs in the text.

            <li>
                If you have a specific project in mind that you would like to
                port, find it on this page, click on it and follow instructions
                there.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you don't have a specific project, pick one of the <a
                href="$MISPACKAGED_LINK">Mispackaged packages</a>, then follow
                the instructions on its page. How about $RANDOMPKG?
            </li>
