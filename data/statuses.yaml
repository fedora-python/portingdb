    No one is working on this package now. You can visit pkgdb for links to the
    upstream project.
    Ask for Python 3 status, and coordinate work with the upstream to port.

    If upstream has Python 3 support but it is not yet in Fedora,
    get in touch with the Fedora maintainer (also visible in pkgdb).
