antlr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      In [a bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1328871),
      the maintainer clarified:

      > so to be clear, gnome-desktop is an old library not used by much
      > anymore. it doesn't have python bindings in the tarball. Those are
      > provided by gnome-python2-desktop.
      >
      > gnome-desktop3 is actively used (in very limited ways), but it relies
      > on gobject introspection to bind to python.

      Note that since
      [gnome-desktop3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-desktop3/)
      uses GObject introspection, it has no own Python code and thus does not
      show up in PortingDB.

        Compatibility package for libraries needed by *applications* that
        cannot switch to Python 3 just yet.

        See [the "Django 2.0" change for Fedora 28](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Django20).

        Replacement: `python-django`
python2-docs:

    note: |
        Documentation for the old Python.

        Replacement: `python3-docs`
python-elixir:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.
python-enum34: &enum
    status: dropped
    note: |
      `enum` is part of the Python 3.4 standard library, so this backport
      is not needed.
python-enum: *enum
python-futures:

  note: |
    This is a backport of `concurrent.futures`, part of the Python 3.2

python-gdata:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This project is no longer actively maintained by Google, and the various
    services handled by this library are moving away from the API versions
    supported by this library.

    Suggested replacement: `google-api-python-client`
python-googlevoice:
    dead-upstream: true
    note: |
        "Project is defunct. Please look to other solutions."
python-igor:
    note: |
        The package is functional under python3, but the executable output
        is  slightly nicer under python2. So it is on py2 on purpose
        according to the maintainer.
python-ipaddr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Python 3.3+ includes the `ipaddress` module, which has been backported
        to Python 2 (`python-ipaddress`).

        Packages that depend on `ipaddr` should consider porting to `ipaddress`.
python-ipaddress:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        In Python 3.3+, ipaddress is in the standard library.
        This is a backport for earlier versions.
python-inotify:
    status: released
    note: |
        `python2-inotify-examples` only contains examples of how `python2-inotify` can be used and does not need to be ported.
python-kerberos:

python-musicbrainz2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        From the [project homepage](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/python-musicbrainz2):

        > Deprecated as of May 2011. This library is not compatible with the
        > current MusicBrainz schema, but will still work with older versions
        > and with the ws/1 legacy web service.

        There is a newer bindings library: `python-musicbrainzngs`.
python-oauth:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        The project is dead. Use another library, like `python-oauth2`, instead.
python-openid:

python-statistics:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    This is a backport of `statistics`, part of the Python 3.4
    standard library.
python-subprocess32:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-toscawidgets:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-tw-forms:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-forms
python-urlgrabber:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      There was a concerted effort to port this package, but it was
      ultimately decided it is unportable (among other things due to dire
      lack of test coverage).
      Suggested replacement: `python-pycurl` which covers most of the
      functionality
python-webtest1.3:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webtest`
python-zbase32: &pyutil-zbase32-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |

python2-ipython:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `ipython`
python2-typing:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        The `typing` module is part of the standard library in Python 3.5+;
        no need for this backport there.
python2-prompt-toolkit:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-prompt-toolkit` (with the `python3-prompt-toolkit`
        binary RPM)
pyutil: *pyutil-zbase32-cycle
pywebkitgtk:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This package provided customized static Python bindings to a GTK
        library.
        GTK3 and GObject introspection provide dynamic bindings that do not
        need to be customized for each language, thus this package is
        not necessary.

        Suggested replacement: `python-gobject` (provides the `gi` module)
        and `webkitgtk4` (provides the `gi.repository.WebKit2` module).
        Note that `webkitgtk4` is not specific to Python and thus does
        not show up in portingdb.

        [An example] that works with Python 3 is provided on the GTK wiki.

vte:

  note: |
    Replacement: [`vte3`](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/)
    (Note that [vte3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/) does
    not itself depend on Python, so it does not show up in portingdb).
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
