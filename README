A database of packages that need porting to Python 3, and tools to manage it.


# Installation

This software is still in the initial phases of development, so it is not
yet packaged. Install it directly from Git working directory:

    $ python3 -m pip install --user -e.


# Usage

First, you will need to load a database.

    $ python3 -m portingdb --datadir data/ load

This will create a `portingdb.sqlite` file in the current directory.
Currently, the database needs re-loaded every time the data changes.
(If the schema changes, you will need to delete the `portingdb.sqlite` file
before re-loading data.)

To check the database, do:

    $ python3 -m portingdb status

To start a HTML report server, start:

    $ python3 -m portingdb serve


# Deployment

Configuration for OpenShift deployment is included in the repository.
As configured, the app will need a Redis server for caching, which can be
added using:
    $ rhc cartridge add "http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/reflect?github=smarterclayton/openshift-redis-cart"
Otherwise it's a standard OpenShift app.
Hot deployment is configured, so the app will continue working while
being deployed. But if the database schema changes between
deployments, the DB file needs to be removed before deploy.
