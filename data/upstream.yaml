abiword:
  note: |
    The single Abi.py file provided upstream is a tiny stub that has no
    compatibility issues. However, the make file component supplied to
    install it contains a command line invocation of Python that's not
    compatible. This has now been corrected in trunk upstream, and should
    be released in Abiword 3.1.

    Upstream doesn't support python3 yet, and needs to be ported, but note that
    upstream seems to be unresponsive.  The last commit was well over a year
    ago and there are a couple pending pull-requests. Fitoria started to work
    on porting this to Python3

  note: |
    Upstream does not presently support Python 3. They are currently dependent
    upon PyGTK (rather than PyGObject), which only supports Python 2. They are
    planning significant refactoring work, and it seems unlikely porting would
    occur prior to that.

    to the Fabric maintainer.  These patches stopped compatibility with
    Python 2.5 and earlier, so the Fabric maintainer did not accept them.
    Mathias forked the code and
    [released the fork to pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fabric3).
    It can be installed with `pip install Fabric3`.
