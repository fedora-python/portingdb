abiword:
  note: |
    The single Abi.py file provided upstream is a tiny stub that has no
    compatibility issues. However, the make file component supplied to
    install it contains a command line invocation of Python that's not
    compatible. This has now been corrected in trunk upstream, and should
    be released in Abiword 3.1.

alacarte:
  note: |
    The current released upstream alacarte (3.11.91, released in 2014) does not
    support python3.

    There is a patch in bugzilla which provides the
    necessary support, but there seems to be no active maintainer to merge it.

  note: |
    Upstream does not presently support Python 3. They are currently dependent
    upon PyGTK (rather than PyGObject), which only supports Python 2. They are
    planning significant refactoring work, and it seems unlikely porting would
    occur prior to that.
