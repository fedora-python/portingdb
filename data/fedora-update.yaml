antlr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      In [a bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1328871),
      the maintainer clarified:

      > so to be clear, gnome-desktop is an old library not used by much
      > anymore. it doesn't have python bindings in the tarball. Those are
      > provided by gnome-python2-desktop.
      >
      > gnome-desktop3 is actively used (in very limited ways), but it relies
      > on gobject introspection to bind to python.

      Note that since
      [gnome-desktop3](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/gnome-desktop3/)
      uses GObject introspection, it has no own Python code and thus does not
      show up in PortingDB.

      cryptography module, and the cryptography features in Python's standard
      library, seems to be a better long-term option for dependent projects.

        not necessary.

        Suggested replacement: `python-gobject` (provides the `gi` module)

    note:
        As mentioned in the upstream pull request, upstream considers this

        Since nothing depends on it in Fedora, porting it does not seem useful.

python-elixir:

    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.

        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

python-peak-rules:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.

python-turbojson:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 where this
      isn't needed.
python-turbokid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and
      a different templating language (genshi is similar to kid) where this
      isn't needed.
python-TurboMail:
    note: |
      Upstream looks dead, project continues under the PyPI name
      `marrow.mailer`, not packaged for Fedora yet.
python-tuskarclient:
    note: |
      From the Fedora bug:

      > The package should be removed as it serves no purpose.
      > The tuskarclient will be replaced by an API provided by
      > [Mistral](https://github.com/dprince/tripleo-mistral-workflows) and
      > [TripleO](https://github.com/openstack/python-tripleoclient)
      > and the UI is replaced by [TripleO UI](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui)

      These packages are not yet in Fedora, though.

python-unicodenazi:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      As the upstream page says, this package is "only useful when porting over
      libraries from Python 2 to Python 3."
python-urlgrabber:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      There was a concerted effort to port this package, but it was
      ultimately decided it is unportable (among other things due to dire
      lack of test coverage).
      Suggested replacement: `python-pycurl` which covers most of the
      functionality
python-weakrefmethod:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of [weakref.WeakMethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakMethod) from Python 3.4+.
      Use the stdlib version in Python 3.
python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webob`
python-webtest1.3:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webtest`
python-zope-interface4:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is a forwards compat package for el6.
        Suggested replacement: `python-zope-interface`
PyQt:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      PyQt 3.x is not maintained upstream any more;
      please switch to `PyQt4` or `python-qt5` when porting.
skeinforge: &skeinforge
  status: dropped
sfact: *skeinforge
subunit:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        A Python 3 subpackage exists, but isn't packaged well yet.
        Also the plugins aren't ported.
tracer:
    note: |
      Upstream supports python3, fedora packager(=upstream) promised to update the spec file. (2016-03-11)
TurboGears:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      TurboGears-1 is not seeing further upstream development.
      Suggested Replacement: TurboGears2 (Similar API but porting will be needed)
vte:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Replacement: [`vte3`](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/vte3/)
    (Note that [vte3](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/vte3/) does
    not itself depend on Python, so it does not show up in portingdb).
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.

    status: dropped

      DNF should replace yum.
