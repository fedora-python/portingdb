      Suggested replacement: `pygobject3`
hippo-canvas: &sugar-toolkit
    status: dropped
    note: |
        From the maintainer, on
        [BZ#1737929](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1737929#c7):

        We're looking to deprecate `hippo-canvas` *\[and `sugar-toolkit`\]*,
        it was used in the old
        gtk2 *\[Sugar\]* Activities, there's a few more to migrate to the gtk3.

        There's overall been a multi year effort to move to python3 including
        moving from gstreamer 0.10 python bindings to py3 friendly
        introspection based gst 1.0 bindings etc.
        There's only a handful of gtk2 based Activities left
        (`repoquery --whatrequires sugar-toolkit`)

postgresql:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Only postgresql-upgrade and postgresql-contrib depend on both Pythons, but this is intentional
        as discussed in a [Fedora bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1571215).
