antlr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      In [a bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1328871),
      the maintainer clarified:

      > so to be clear, gnome-desktop is an old library not used by much
      > anymore. it doesn't have python bindings in the tarball. Those are
      > provided by gnome-python2-desktop.
      >
      > gnome-desktop3 is actively used (in very limited ways), but it relies
      > on gobject introspection to bind to python.

      Note that since
      [gnome-desktop3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gnome-desktop3/)

        Replacement: `python-django`
python-elixir:

    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.
python-enum34: &enum

python-ipaddr:

        Python 3.3+ includes the `ipaddress` module, which has been backported
        to Python 2 (`python-ipaddress`).

        Packages that depend on `ipaddr` should consider porting to `ipaddress`.
python-ipaddress:

        In Python 3.3+, ipaddress is in the standard library.
        This is a backport for earlier versions.
python-inotify:

python-irclib:

        Update with python3 support has been [packaged in copr](https://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/toshio/python-irclib-update/).
        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.

python-peak-rules:

  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.

python-tgmochikit:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      javascript framework like jquery.
python-toscawidgets:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-turbocheetah:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream   Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      templating library like jinja2.
python-turbojson:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 where this
      isn't needed.
python-turbokid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and
      a different templating language (genshi is similar to kid) where this
      isn't needed.
python-TurboMail:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-marrow-mailer`

      Upstream is dead, project continues under the new name.
python-tw-forms:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-forms
python-twiggy:

        bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282112
python-unicodenazi:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      As the upstream page says, this package is "only useful when porting over
      libraries from Python 2 to Python 3."
python-upoints:
    note: |
      Depends on [aaargh](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aaargh/0.7.1),
      which isn't packaged yet.
python-urlgrabber:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      There was a concerted effort to port this package, but it was
      ultimately decided it is unportable (among other things due to dire
      lack of test coverage).
      Suggested replacement: `python-pycurl` which covers most of the
      functionality
python-weakrefmethod:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of [weakref.WeakMethod](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakMethod) from Python 3.4+.
      Use the stdlib version in Python 3.
python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webob`
python-webtest1.3:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webtest`
python-whisper:
    note: |
        Whisper as library is python3 compatible, but the executables not yet.
python-zbase32: &pyutil-zbase32-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Only `python-zbase32` depends on `pyutil`, and `pyutil` depends back
      on `python-zbase32`.
python2-astroid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-astroid`
python2-faulthandler:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Part of the the standard library in Python 3.3+.
python2-ipython:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `ipython`
python2-lxc:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python3-lxc`
python2-typing:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        The `typing` module is part of the standard library in Python 3.5+;
        no need for this backport there.
python2-pylint:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python3-pylint`
python2-pyx:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `PyX`
pyutil: *pyutil-zbase32-cycle
pywebkitgtk:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This package provided customized static Python bindings to a GTK
        library.
        GTK3 and GObject introspection provide dynamic bindings that do not
        need to be customized for each language, thus this package is
        not necessary.

        Suggested replacement: `python-gobject` (provides the `gi` module)
        and `webkitgtk4` (provides the `gi.repository.WebKit2` module).
        Note that `webkitgtk4` is not specific to Python and thus does
        not show up in portingdb.

        [An example] that works with Python 3 is provided on the GTK wiki.

        [An example]: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/WebKitGtk/ProgrammingGuide/Bindings-libnotify
subunit:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        A Python 3 subpackage exists, but isn't packaged well yet.
        Also the plugins aren't ported.
texlive-base:
    status: idle
    note: |
        texlive-pythontex depends on both Pythons by design upstream. See discussion
        in the Bugzilla for more details.
tomoe-gtk: *devel-only
tracer:
    note: |
      Upstream supports python3, fedora packager(=upstream) promised to update the spec file. (2016-03-11)
TurboGears:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      TurboGears-1 is not seeing further upstream development.
      Suggested Replacement: TurboGears2 (Similar API but porting will be needed)
vegastrike: &vegastrike-cycle
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Only `vegastrike` depends on `vegastrike-data`, and `vegastrike-data` depends back
      on `vegastrike`.
vegastrike-data: *vegastrike-cycle
vte:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    Replacement: [`vte3`](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/)
    (Note that [vte3](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/vte3/) does
    not itself depend on Python, so it does not show up in portingdb).
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
wxPython:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python-wxpython4`
yum:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `dnf`
yum-metadata-parser:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      A `yum` dependency. `yum` is replaced by `dnf`
yum-utils:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      DNF should replace yum.
python-shove:
    note: |
        [threebean](http://threebean.org) is working on this.
