        Some components are not ported yet.
byobu:
    status: in-progress
    links:
        repo: https://github.com/dperson/byobu
    note: |
        [dperson] Pull accepted upstream (will be in 5.100). Updated the `spec`
        file to fix the she-bang lines on build. Submited it to the maintainer.
        Maintainer will wait on Fedora 24 to change script interpreter.
cmake:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Looks like a stray dependency on py2
createrepo:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This has a dependency on `yum`, which is not going to be ported.

        Dependant packages should be ported to `createrepo_c`.
fedmsg:
    status: in-progress
    note: |
        The python3-fedmsg-core package is done and available, but the commands
        modules won't be do-able until twisted is done.

    note: |
        [rodrigc](https://github.com/rodrigc) is submitting fixes in [his repo](https://github.com/rodrigc/kernel-tests).

        There is no bugzilla component for this package, discussion is
        goint on in the mailing list (kernel@lists.fedoraproject.org),
        and known bugs with the port are reported on
        [Github](https://github.com/rodrigc/kernel-tests/issues).
gstreamer-python:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python-gstreamer1`
libssh2-python:
    note: |
        Code is old, but it's just a binding: it seems to work with Python 3.4
        Should it be renamed python{2,3}-libssh2?
lorem-ipsum-generator:
    links:
        repo: https://github.com/Riamse/lorem-ipsum-generator/
    note: |
        Riamse is doing it.
        This has been ported. All we're waiting for is for upstream to point the sources to this repo.
lunatic-python:
    note: |
        There is a better alternative which supports Python3, Lupa.
m2crypto:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-cryptography`
pycairo:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-cairo`
pygame:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        No `python3-pygame-devel` equivalent
pygobject2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gobject`
pygtk2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gobject`
pyliblzma:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Upstream may be dead.
      Recommend porting to the [lzma library in the stdlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html)
      (with python2 code using `python-backports-lzma`)
pyPdf:
    status: dropped
    links:
        bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=991102
    note: |
        Suggested replacement: `python-PyPDF2`, which has official py3+ support on v1.20 onwards.
pyserial:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Bug 1187837 - A file in the python2 backage requires python3.
pysnmp:
    note: |
        Current build version should support Python 3.
python:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is the Python 2 package.
      Please port to Python 3.
python-backports:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        By definition, the new Python version does not need backports!
python-backports-lzma:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Included in Python 3.3
python-backports-ssl_match_hostname:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Included in Python 3.2
python-BeautifulSoup:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-beautifulsoup4`
python-bunch:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python-munch` (Same API)
python-cherrypy:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python3-cherrypy`
python-cherrypy2:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that needs to be run on
      python3 needs to be ported to a current version of this framework.
      Replacement: `python3-cherrypy`
python-docs:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        Replacement: `python3-docs`
python-elixir:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.
python-instant:
    note: |
      spec file updated and built in rawhide by [fab](http://fabian-affolter.ch).
python-irclib:
    note: |
        Update with python3 support has been [packaged in copr](https://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/toshio/python-irclib-update/).
        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.
python-kerberos:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python-kid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-genshi`
      Not a drop-in replacement but genshi's templating language is based on
      kid's so it's the closest thing.  python-kid is dead upstream.
python-krbV:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python-ldap:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-pyldap` (drop-in, provides the `ldap` module)
python-lzo:
    note: |
            A new upstream maintainer has appeared and [merged python3 support](https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo/pull/8) to their
            tree but still needs to [make a new release](https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo/issues/9).
python-matplotlib:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Ported except for the wx backend, which depends on xwPython.
python-memcached:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `python3-memcached`
python-mpd:
    note: |
        [threebean](http://threebean.org) submitted a patch for this.
python-mutagen:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        Ported, but the devel package needs py3
python-nss:

python-odict:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Included in Python 2.7 / 3.1 standard library as
      [`collections.OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict).
python-openid:

python-peak-rules:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.
python-prioritized_methods:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    See the notes for [python-peak-rules](http://fedora.portingdb.xyz/pkg/python-peak-rules/)
    which this depends upon.
python-pyudev:
  nonblocking: true
  note: |
    Some backends are not yet ported.
python-subprocess32:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-tgmochikit:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      javascript framework like jquery.
python-toscawidgets:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-turbocheetah:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream   Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer
      templating library like jinja2.
python-turbojson:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 where this
      isn't needed.
python-turbokid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Dead upstream.  Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and
      a different templating language (genshi is similar to kid) where this
      isn't needed.
python-tw-forms:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-forms
python-twiggy:
    links:
        bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1282112
python-webob1.1:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webob`
python-webtest1.3:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      This is a backwards compatibility package.  Code that uses this should be
      ported to the current version of the library as part of porting to
      python3.
      Replacement: `python-webtest`
skeinforge: &skeinforge
  status: dropped
sfact: *skeinforge
subunit:
    nonblocking: true
    note: |
        A Python 3 subpackage exists, but isn't packaged well yet.
        Also the plugins aren't ported.
tracer:
    note: |
      Upstream seems to have support for python3.
      The fedora packager is also upstream.
TurboGears:
    statue: dropped
    note: |
      TurboGears-1 is not seeing further upstream development.
      Suggested Replacement: TurboGears2 (Similar API but porting will be needed)
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
yum:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Replacement: `-dnf`
python-shove:
    note: |
        [threebean](http://threebean.org) is working on this.
youtube-dl:
    note: |
        spec updated and built for Rawhide
    links:
        repo: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/
python-retask:
    status: in-progress
    note: |
        [sayanchowdhury](https://github.com/sayanchowdhury) is working on this.
        version 4.0 has a broken import so the build fails. There is a pending
        [PR](https://github.com/kushaldas/retask/pull/9)
