antlr:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        This is ANTLR 2, quite an old version. Fedora also has ``antlr3``
        and ``antlr4`` packages, but it seems Python support is not included
        in those (?, 2016-03-01).

        When porting, the best course of action seems to be switching to
        ANTLR 4, which has Python 3 support upstream.

      While upstream is making progress porting m2crypto, moving to the
      cryptography module, and the cryptography features in Python's standard

python-atfork:
    status: dropped
    note:
        As mentioned in the upstream pull request, upstream considers this
        project dead.

        Since nothing depends on it in Fedora, porting it does not seem useful.

      The package is retired. The feature itself is included in django directly.
      Suggested replacement: `python-django`
python-django-profiles:

    note: |
        Due to changes in Django making it effectively obsolete, this

python-docker-registry-core:

    note: |
        Replacement: `python3-docs`
python-elixir:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python3-sqlalchemy` has a builtin declarative
      layer now.  Porting to that is most likely the best route forward.
      `python-elixir` had some work done in its source repository to support
      python3 but that was never released.  The source repository has since
      been taken down so that work has been lost and upstream appears to
      have died.
python-enum34: &enum

        Python 3.3+ includes the `ipaddress` module, which has been backported

        Packages that depend on `ipaddr` should consider porting to `ipaddress`.
python-ipaddress:
    status: dropped
    note: |
        In Python 3.3+, ipaddress is in the standard library.
        This is a backport for earlier versions.

      spec file updated and built in rawhide by [fab](http://fabian-affolter.ch).
python-irclib:
    note: |
        Update with python3 support has been [packaged in copr](https://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/toshio/python-irclib-update/).
        Requires additional packages to build (which are present in the copr repository).

        Copr packager doesn't have time to maintain the package so needs Fedora maintainers
        to take over maintenance.
python-kerberos:
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-gssapi`
python-kid:
    status: dropped
    note: |
      Suggested replacement: `python-genshi`
      Not a drop-in replacement but genshi's templating language is based on

python-peak-rules:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    In April of 2015 upstream did some work to port this to python3 but that
    work hasn't been completed or pushed to a release package yet.  This
    package is not currently needed by any Fedora package that is to be ported
    to python3 so no one on the Fedora side has had a desire to work on porting
    for upstream.  Note that python-peak-rules and its dependencies interact
    with some low-level pieces of python so porting work is different than
    other packages.
python-prioritized_methods:
  status: dropped
  note: |
    See the notes for [python-peak-rules](http://fedora.portingdb.xyz/pkg/python-peak-rules/)

python-pyudev:

python-subprocess32:

    note: |
      This is a backport of the subprocess module in python-3.2 to python2.
      For python3 code, just use subprocess from the stdlib.
python-tgcaptcha2:
    status: blocked
    note: |
        Depends on `python-fedora-turbogears` (part of `python-fedora`),

python-tgmochikit:

python-toscawidgets:

    note: |
      Suggested Replacement: python-tw2-core (toscawidgets2).  Porting will be needed as it
      is not a drop in replacement.
python-turbocheetah:

    note: |
      Dead upstream   Part of TurboGears-1.  Port to TurboGears2 and a newer

      `marrow.mailer`, not packaged for Fedora yet.
python-tuskarclient:
    note: |
      From the Fedora bug:

      > The package should be removed as it serves no purpose.
      > The tuskarclient will be replaced by an API provided by
      > [Mistral](https://github.com/dprince/tripleo-mistral-workflows) and
      > [TripleO](https://github.com/openstack/python-tripleoclient)

    Replacement: [`vte3`](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/vte3/)
    (Note that [vte3](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/vte3/) does
    not itself depend on Python, so it does not show up in portingdb).
will-crash:
    status: released  # (exception)
    note: |
        will-crash tests that abrt will detect a crash and report properly.
        It contains a crashing program for both python2 and python3 so that
        it can test that abrt handles both python2 and python3 tracebacks.

        So, the RPM requires both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3.
